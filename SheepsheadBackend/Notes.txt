How to play:
1. Deal
    - Each player is dealt 3 cards at a time
    - Once each player receives their 3 deal 2 in middle face down
    - deal each player 3 more cards 3 at a time

2. Objective
    - Each player takes their turn placing cards down during the "trick"
    - If Trump card is played during the trick then that player wins the trick
    - If no Trump cards are played then player with the highest ranking card wins
    - Trumps
        - Clubs > Spades > Hearts > Diamonds
        - Queens > Jacks > Diamonds (excluding queen and jack)
    - Win 61 or more card points
        - Card points are awarded by total number of points from tricks won
        - i.e. sum of card points for each card won in a trick
    - Player left of dealer has the option to become the picker and take the 2 middle cards
        - Player should become picker if they believe that they can win 60
        or more points in a round
        - If player does not think they can then it proceeds around the circle
        until picked
        - Picker
            - Picker gets to choose a partner for the round
                - Partners points and Pickers points are combined
                - Other 3 players are on a team for the round as well and points combined
                - To pick a partner, picker calls a not trump ace in a suit that matches a
                non trump card in their hand
                - Partner does not make it known that they have been chosen
                    - Once called ace is played in a trick it is known who the partner is
                - Once partner is picked, 2 cards are buried by the picker
                    - Buried cards count towards the pickers card point total
    - Player left of dealer leads first trick
    - Players must follow the lead suit by playing trump cards if possible
    - Highest ranking card wins suit
    - Player that wins trick leads next trick
        - Cards won in trick are not used in hand
    - If player cannot follow suit they can play any card they want
    - Suit: Trump/Fail
